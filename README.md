# Threeam Trash - QuickSort
### Adrian Kloskowski, Woosuk Lee, Ryan Kim
#### Background
QuickSort is a type of algorithm that sorts an array of comparable values in order. It works by implementing the partition function, which divides an array (or subarray) into three sections: a pivot value (placed at its final index), a subarray of values lesser than the partition in value and index, and a subarray of values greater than the partition in value and index. By repeating recursively on each subarray, QuickSort places each value of the array into their sorted locations.

The goal of this project is to create an implementation of QuickSort and measure its efficiency.
#### Hypothesis
Our implementation of QuickSort should, on average, have an O(nlogn) runtime.
